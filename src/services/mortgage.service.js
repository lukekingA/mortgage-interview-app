/**
 * Calculates the total amount paid over a loan
 * term given the amount, interest rate, and number of years.
 *
 * Amount   - Total amount of the loan as a whole number (dollars)
 * Interest - Interest rate expressed as a percentage.
 *            I.e. 5.5% interest rate should be expressed as the
 *            decimal number 5.5
 * Term     - The number of years it will take for the loan to be
 *            paid off. In this example, you should only use 15 or 30.
